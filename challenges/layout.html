                <h2>Structure, Phrasing, and Display</h2>
                <p>The difference between structural (block) elements and phrasing (inline) elements
                in HTML is that they are displayed differently. By default, a block element will 
                start on a new line and take up the full width that's available. An example of a block
                element is a div element. On the other hand, an inline element will not start on a new line
                and only takes up as much width as it needs. An example of an inline element is a span
                element.</p>
                <p>The CSS display property has more than 20 possible values, including inline, block,
                flex, grid, and flex. The display value will specify how the element will be rendered
                on the page. Using these display values, elements can be displayed as different containers
                such as flex or grid containers and in different widths such as inline and block.</p>

                <h2>Box Model</h2>  
                <p>The CSS box model views all HTML elments as content wrapped in more boxes. From 
                inside out, the boxes are content, padding, border, and margin. The content consists
                of the text and images of the HTML element. The padding is the area directly around
                the content and is transparent. The border wraps around the content and padding; the 
                margin wraps around the border and is also transparent.</p>
                <p>The box model can be changed with box-sizing in CSS as this property includes 
                the padding and border in an element's total width and height. By default, actual width
                and height of element's are the sum of its width/height + padding + border.
                As a result, seting width/height often makes the element appear larger than you want.
                This is because the HTML element's border and padding are added to the specified 
                dimension.</p>

                <h2>Background Images</h2>
                <p>With CSS or HTML, one can set the background of an element can be set to a
                color or an image. In CSS, background images can be specified with the 
                background-image value. The value consists of the URL to the image contained in 
                url('insertULRtoImage'). Multiple images can be specified by listing each URL
                and separate them with commas. By default, the background-image is placed in the
                top left corner of an element and repeated vertically & horizontally to fit its 
                container. If the image is unavailable, it will display a background color so it's
                best that you specify a background-color value just in case. Background images
                are different from images loaded onto the webpage with img tags as they are not
                HTML elements but are used to style HTML elements</p>
